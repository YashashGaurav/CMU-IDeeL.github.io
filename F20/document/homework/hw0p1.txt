Once you have set-up your development environment – with Conda, PyTorch, and CUDA – this assignment requires two things: 1) you must install numba via anaconda, 2) you must submit a .txt of what is output from running `numba -s` in your console. Your submission will be the .txt of the results. NOTE: This is to be done on an AWS instance and not on your local machine.
