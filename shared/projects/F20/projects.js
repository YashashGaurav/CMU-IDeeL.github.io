        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful learning technique that enables agents to learn useful\u00a0policies by interacting directly with the environment.\u00a0 While this training approach doesn\u2019t require labeled data, it is plagued with convergence issues and is highly sample inefficient. The learned policies are often very specific to the task at hand and are not generalizable to similar task spaces. Metal-ReinforcementLearning is a one strategy that can mitigate these issues, enabling robots to acquire new skills much more quickly. Often described as \u201clearning how to learn\u201d, it allows agents to leverage prior experience much more effectively.\u00a0 Recently published papers in Meta learning show impressive speed and sample efficiency improvements over traditional methods of relearning the task for slight variations in the task objectives.\u00a0 A concern with these meta-learning methods was that their success was only achieved on relatively small modifications to the initial task.\u00a0 Another Concern in RL is reproducibility and lack of standardization of the metrics and approaches, which can lead to wide variations in reported vs observed performances. To alleviate that, benchmarking frameworks have been proposed that establish a common ground for a fair comparison between approaches. In this work, we aim to utilize the task variety proposed by Meta-World and compare PPO, a vanilla policy gradient algorithm, vs their meta-learning counterparts\u00a0 (MAML\u00a0 and\u00a0 Reptile). \u00a0 The\u00a0 objective\u00a0 is\u00a0 to\u00a0 verify\u00a0 the\u00a0 magnitude of success of meta-learning algorithms over the vanilla variants, and test them on a variety of complicated tasks to test their limits in responding to the size of task variations. We also introduce a new technique - Multi-headed Reptile,which addresses some of the shortcomings of both these meta learning techniques. Additionally, we propose a method to speed up the training process to compensate for the general lack of vectorizability of some parts of reinforcement learning algorithms.",

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial samples - perturbed samples that are imperceptible to a human, but can cause the deep learning model to give incorrect predictions with a high confidence. This limitation has been a major deterrent in the deployment of deep learning algorithms in production, specifically in security critical systems. In this project, we followed a game theoretic approach to implement a novel defense strategy, that combines multiple Stochastic Activation Pruning with adversarial training. Our defense accuracy outperforms that of PGD adversarial training, which is known to be the one of the best defenses against several Lâˆž attacks, by about 6-7%. We are hopeful that our defense strategy can withstand strong attacks leading to more robust deep neural network models.",

        "summary": "Adversarial attacks can generate adversarial inputs by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to samples from the data set, which leads to even state-of-the-art deep neural networks outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Hence, some adversarial defense techniques are developed to improve the security and robustness of the models and avoid them being attacked. Gradually, a game-like competition between attackers and defenders formed, in which both players would attempt to play their best strategies against each other while maximizing their own payoffs. To solve the game, each player would choose an optimal strategy against the opponent based on the prediction of the opponent\u2019s strategy choice. In this work, we are on the defensive side to apply game-theoretic approaches on adversarial training the models. We generate adversarial training samples by assuming attackers would do a fast gradient sign method (FGSM) white-box attack. Using both the raw data set and generated data set to train the models, we reduce the test data set error while the models being attacked on the CIFAR-10 data set. Our experimental results indicate that the adversarial training method can effectively improve the robustness of deep-learning neural networks. Our proposed method aims to use diverse networks to simulate the mixed strategy thus to reduce the success rate of attack",

Most previous research on sketch generation assume that the original photo is available, which are usually unavailable from description of suspects. Since text-to-face synthesis is a sub-domain of text-to-image synthesis, there are only a few research focusing in this sub-domain (although it has more relative values in the public safety domain). Here, we use AttentionGAN to generate sketches from the text descriptions. Our AttentionGAN successfully captures the text semantics into sketch image domain.",

The idea is to approach adversarial attacks and defenses through a game-theoretic perspective, thus coming up with robust defenses for the model under consideration. In our approach, we tried to implement models with good classification accuracy and subject them to two of the most popular attacks Fast Gradient Sign method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).Ideally, the attacks should be assumed to be belonging to the class of White box attacks, because the defense assumes the worst case scenario. The game between the attacker and defender is modeled as a multi-move game with zero-sum reward where the defender has the last move advantage. In accordance with this, we defend against the \u201cattack\u201d after we get the image from the attacker.

We evaluated its performance under the context of white-box attacks, comparing to the state-of-the-art robust defense model architecture, TRADES. The Layer-wise Divergence Control mechanism we proposed can achieve similar performance to TRADES against PGD INF attacks. In terms of PGD L2 attacks, TRADES significantly outperforms our mechanism.

In this report, we have described the methods employed to estimate disparity from low texture, noisy IR data. For the baseline architectures, we have selected AANet (Adaptive Aggregation Network)and GA-Net (Guided Aggregation Net), which are state of the art architectures for disparity estimation using RGB stereo images. These models employ fewer 3Dconvolutional layers, which enables operation at real time speeds. In experiments,we show how these models perform on IR stereo data, after extensive tuning of parameters. For training and evaluation, we use the CATS (A Color And Thermal Stereo) dataset and yet to be published, CMU dataset.

While deep learning for pedestrian detection in RGB images has achieved good performance in supervised deep learning, the learned model tempts to overfit a specific dataset. Another problem is that RGB cameras can be influenced by lightning or camera range, making the model hard to be applied in realistic scenes. Thermal images have the advantages that they are invariant with lighting and have a larger detection range. However, training a new deep model requires a large dataset, and collecting many annotated data is expensive and time-consuming. To reduce this bottleneck, we utilize semi-supervised transfer learning, including active-learning and self-training, to train on a dataset with a limited number of labels, to reduce the labeling cost. The semi-supervised learning algorithm usually has lower performance than supervised training on a large dataset.

Therefore, our team will explore novel ways of feature extraction to improve the performance of speech recognition.",

        "summary": "We proposed two approaches to perform antibiotic molecule discovery and classification: 1. Simple Graph Neural Network: Applying graph neural network on atom/bond level features. 2. Fingerprint Vector Model: Applying conventional neural network on molecular level features (molecular fingerprint). We prepared a dataset of 2335 molecules with labels, and extracted atom/bond/molecular features from the dataset. Baseline models are built for both approaches. While graph neural network model is still in training, Multi-layer perceptron model applied to molecular fingerprints is able to achieve a 85.8% testing accuracy. However, we discovered that the dataset is unbalanced, with 95% of samples in one label. Since the data is collected by biochemistry experiments, the amount of data is limited. We decide to use data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensembling in our future work. In the rest of semester, our goal is to improve current situation of limited number of data and enhance performance of current models.",

Rhyming is a unique feature of poetry that we thought would be a new and challenging generation task for a GPT-2 model. We have trained the GPT-2 model on a limerick corpus of 90,000 from oedilf.com. We developed several automatic evaluation metrics such as rhyming coherence, subject co-reference and nonsense evaluation. We also developed a website where we asked people if they could distinguish Human limericks from our training set vs. novel generated limericks from our model. Preliminary results show that we were able to fool the human 76 times or ~17% of the responses. Based on the rhyming structure of limericks (AABBA) we have named and will refer to our model as AiBBA.",

Starting with the break-through work of Long et al.

Aside from seeking solutions in general model design for information shrinkage due to pooling [], urban-scene image itself has intrinsic features like positional patterns[3]. Our project seeks an advanced and integrated solution that specifically targets urban-scene image semantic segmentation among the most novel approaches in the current field. We re-implemented the cutting edge model DeepLabv3+[cite] withResNet-101[cite] backbone. Based upon DeepLabv3+, we incorporated Height-Driven Attention Net [3] to account the vertical pixel information distribution in urban-scene image tasks. To boost up model efficiency and performance, we further explored the Atrous Spatial Pooling(ASP) layer in DeepLabv3+ and infused a computational-efficient variation called \"Waterfall\" Atrous Spatial Pooling(WASP)[4] architecture in our model. We found that our two-step integrated model im-proves the mean Intersection-Over-Union(mIoU) score gradually from the baseline model.

While the number of cases are rising on a daily basis, there is a steady need to keep up rising number of cases and automate the diagnosis of COVID-19, offloading some of the work off the front-line workers. It is a known fact that medical image data suffers from skewness due to the limited availability of positive COVID-19 patient data. Deep learning models rely heavily on the uniformity of the data to produce a good result and hence often overfit on highly skewed data. Increasing the number of training samples has been shown to provide better classification accuracy and more generalizability. Due to strict protocols for medical data collection, it is not feasible to collect additional data for training. In a scenario like this, the best approach is to perform data augmentation on the available training samples to reduce class imbalance and generate more samples. Many approaches to data augmentation have been proposed, from basic image transformations to using a Generative network to create new images. In this work, we apply a combination of Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks to augment the COVID-19 data on which a CNN-based classifier is trained to achieve a better performance.",

However, a significant amount of approaches based on supervised machine learning models that require (big) labelled data-set. In this project, we are expected to detect the pattern of heartbeat with an optimized Auto-Encoder model. Our contributions can be divided as three steps. Firstly, we established two baseline models (MLP and LSTM auto-encoder) on MNIST dataset. The result shows good sensitivity to distinguish from different data.

Traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) differ from SNNs in that they use event-rates, the number of spikes within a given time window, to encode and process information. One main advantage of SNNs over ANNs is their lower energy use, this is due to the fact SNNs require less memory storage than ANNs. Because SNNs encode information using binary spike trains, modeled using dirac-delta functions, the derivatives for individual neurons do not always exist making error backpropagation impossible. To handle this problem, researchers have created SNN backpropagation algorithms that either 1) roughly approximate or 2) calculate exactly the derivative of the output at each neuron at an event-time. In our final report, we will present a complete comparison between an approximate and exact SNN backpropagation algorithm, known as SpikeProp and EventProp, respectively.",
